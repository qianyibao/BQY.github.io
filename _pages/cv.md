## Work Experience
### Algorithm Team Lead
**Hundsun Electronics Co., Ltd.** (Top 100 Global FinTech Companies)  
*July 2024 - September 2025*  
- **Company Introduction**: Listed FinTech enterprise, ranked 22nd in FinTech100 2024 (1st in Asia), with ~10,000 employees. Provides one-stop digital solutions for securities, futures, funds, trusts, and banks. Launched China's first financial-specific large model "LightGPT" and "Photon" intelligent assistant in 2023.

- **Key Responsibilities**:
  1. FinTech AI Frontier Research: Conducted strategic research on generative AI, large models, and agents; promoted technology landing in core businesses (intelligent customer service, internal efficiency improvement); reported to decision-makers regularly.
  2. Team Building & Technical Planning: Led team in large model training and financial data governance through technical seminars, architecture design, and cross-department collaboration.
  3. Technical Achievement Dissemination: Led the compilation and review of AI technical white papers and industry standards; enhanced team's technical influence in the FinTech AI field.
  4. Project Management: Oversaw full project lifecycle (initiation to delivery), controlling progress, cost, and quality to ensure successful implementation.

## Project Experience
### 1. Large-Scale Financial Software System Efficiency Improvement Project (Phase I)
**Role**: Algorithm Team Lead | *September 2024 - March 2025*  
- **Project Description**: Led an intelligent R&D efficiency improvement project for ~1,000 R&D personnel. Core goal: Achieve accurate mapping from natural language requirements to target code files via fine-tuned large models, improving collaboration efficiency by 60%.

- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Designed large model fine-tuning technical route for "requirement-to-code file mapping"; led data annotation, model selection, fine-tuning, and evaluation; built 300,000 labeled data (public + vertical domain).
  - Developed "model generation → fuzzy search" retrieval architecture integrated with code call graphs; achieved 82% recall rate, 75% precision rate, and average retrieval time < 4s.
  - Led a 6-person team to deliver algorithm modules on schedule; established data flywheel effect; ensured project meets business requirements through evaluation data analysis.

- **Achievements**:
  - Successfully delivered project milestones (initial/medium/final acceptance); accumulated 5.4 million RMB in payments.
  - Received high praise from internal business departments.

### 2. Large-Scale Financial Software System Efficiency Improvement Project (Phase II)
**Role**: Algorithm Team Lead | *March 2025 - August 2025*  
- **Project Description**: Applied agent technology to the efficiency improvement project based on fine-tuned large models, further increasing R&D efficiency to 72%.

- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Designed "retrieval agent" technical route; led tool design, framework selection, and memory specification; built 100,000 agent operation trajectories.
  - Integrated code repository call graphs; designed agent workflow ("retrieve suspicious files → browse adjacent files") and dynamic code summarization; achieved 92% recall rate, 84% precision rate, and average retrieval time < 6s.

- **Achievements**:
  - Successfully deployed online and met acceptance indicators.
  - Led the compilation of *Industry Research Report on Tool Standards for Financial Agents*.
  - Initiated high-level paper writing based on project outcomes (targeting SCI Q1).

## Published Papers
1. **First Author**, 2025  
   "Improving Knowledge Distillation via Cross-Modal Insights from CLIP"  
   *ICASSP* (IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing), equivalent to SCI Q2.

2. **Second Author**, 2024  
   "A Multi-Level Relation-Aware Transformer Model for Occluded Person Re-Identification"
